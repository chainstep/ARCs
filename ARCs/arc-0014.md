# Binary Interface for Controlled Transfer of Non-Fungible Tokens

## Summary

This document introduces a binary interface as described in [ABI-4] for controlling the transfer of Algorand Standard Assets (ASAs) for non-fungible tokens (NFTs).

## Abstract

The goal of this specification is to make it simpler for block explorers, wallets, exchanges, marketplaces, and more generally, client software to transfer
a given ASA following a ruleset specified by a smart contract.

## Specification

The key words "**MUST**", "**MUST NOT**", "**REQUIRED**", "**SHALL**", "**SHALL NOT**", "**SHOULD**", "**SHOULD NOT**", "**RECOMMENDED**", "**MAY**", and "**OPTIONAL**" in this document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC-2119](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2119.txt).

  "methods": [
    { "name": "mintNft", "args": [...], ... },
    { "name": "certifyNft", "args": [...], ... }
    { "name": "burnNft", "args": [...], ... }
  ]
}

        },

    },
}

            "type": "uint",
            "desc": "Asset ID",
        },
    ],
    "returns": {
        "type": "bool",
        "desc": "NFT meets the standards of this factory contract",
    },
}

{
    "name": "burnNft",
    "args": [
        {
            "type": "uint",

    ],
    "returns": {
        "type": "bool",
        "desc": "burn success",
    },
}

```

### The ABI interface

```
{
  "name": "asaNftRoyaltyAbs",
  "methods": [
    { "name": "transferNft", "args": [...], ... }
    { "name": "calculateNetPrice", "args": [...], ... }
  ]
}

{
    "name": "transferNft",
    "args": [
        {
            "name": "asaId",
            "type": "uint",
            "desc": "NFT id",
        },
       {
            "name": "sender",
            "type": "account",
            "desc": "Nft sender account",
        },
        {
            "name": "receiver",
            "type": "account",
            "desc": "Nft receiver account",
        },
        {
            "name": "price",
            "type": "uint",
            "desc": "agreed price in uAlgo",
        },
    ],
    "returns": {
        "type": "(uint,account)[]",
        "desc": "amount paid to seller, and royalty recipients in uAlgo",
    },
}

{
    "name": "calculateNetPrice",
    "args": [
        {
            "name": "asaId",
            "type": "uint",
            "desc": "NFT id",
        },
        {
            "name": "price",
            "type": "uint",
            "desc": "agreed price in uAlgo",
        },
    ],
    "returns": {
        "type": "uint",
        "desc": "amount paid to seller when sold for given price in uAlgo",
    },
}
```

## High level flow

The ABI should be the only address able to control the transfer of the NFT. Thus,

1. The ASA subject to the royalty MUST be created as Default Frozen, with no Freeze Address.
1. The Clawback Address of the ASA subject to the royalty MUST be assigned to an App (possible starting from TEAL 5).
1. The ASA subject to the royalty MUST be only transferred with Clawback.
1. The Manager Address of the ASA subject to the royalty SHOULD be deleted (to avoid unforeseen modification of the royalty ex-post).
1. Given the royalty policy, known in advance, the ABI MUST calculate the royalty amounts on every transaction.
1. The ABI MUST NOT allow the modification of the royalty policy
1. The ABI MAY include a whitelisting

The ABI implementation needs to permanently store _who_ receives _which royalties_.

1. The ABI implementation MUST be created with well-defined royalties and assigned collectors
1. A royalty MUST either be a fixed percentage of the sales price, or a fixed percentage of the profit created through the NFT sale.
1. A royalty collector MUST be either a static address or an relative index into previous owner
